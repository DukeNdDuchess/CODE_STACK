**NOTE : ALL FILES ARE IN [IPYTHON]((jupyter.org)) EXTENSION CODED IN [PYTHON 2](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.2/). SO TO HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF CODES WITH PROVIDED OUTPUT**

## EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS

---

* You're suggested to have [IPYTHON](jupyter.org) installed for ease.
* You'll need [graphlab](https://turi.com/download/install-graphlab-create.html) to run the  following two programs:
  * [K_FOLD_CROSS_VALIDATION.ipynb](https://github.com/DukeNdDuchess/CODE_STACK/blob/master/K_FOLD_CROSS_VALIDATION.ipynb)
  * [REGRESSION_ANALYSIS_L2_NORM_GRADIENT DESCENT.ipynb](https://github.com/DukeNdDuchess/CODE_STACK/blob/master/REGRESSION_ANALYSIS_L2_NORM_GRADIENT%20DESCENT.ipynb)
* Rest of the programs could be simply executed with Numpy.

## CONTENTS

---

* The files contains different algorithmic approach to solve the Edit Distance Problem and generating possible alignment to minimize the complexity in terms of both Time and Space Complexity.
* The above two files are based on Regression analysis with gradient descent, and implementing the 10-fold cross validation algorithm for choosing the the best tuning parameter for regularization. (corresponding data set has also been provided)
